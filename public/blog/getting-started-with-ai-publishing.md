The modern AI ecosystem includes:
- Large Language Models (LLMs) that need structured text
- AI agents that require specific protocol formats
- Claude and other assistants with custom skill formats
- MCP servers for seamless integration

## Supported Formats

### Claude Skills

### llms.txt

### MCP Server
Model Context Protocol integration provides a robust way to share your content with AI systems that support this emerging standard.

### AI Agent
Autonomous agent capabilities that transform your content into intelligent assistants ready to help users.
